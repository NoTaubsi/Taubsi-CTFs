session_start
    -> creates new session OR resumes session from Cookie-Session-ID
        -> Can't Bruteforce Cookie
        -> Cookie domain is same as site (natas22.natas)
    
    -> checks for REVELIO key in $_GET. it only reads it for a comparison.
        -> 

    -> checks for $_SESSION variable
        -> php source doesn't show any input into $_SESSION
            -> does this mean I need to find an active admin connection?
